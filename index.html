    <h1>Good Luck in your KCSE!</h1>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúThis moment is here, and so are you.
    Not by luck, not by chance‚Äîby the steps you took, the nights you stayed,
    The fears you faced and the strength you built.

    Don‚Äôt hurry. Don‚Äôt fight the silence inside.
    Breathe deep. Feel your heart steady like the earth beneath your feet.

    You are more than this test.
    This moment is here, and so are you.
Not by luck, not by chance‚Äîby the steps you took, the nights you stayed,
The fears you faced and the strength you built.

        Don‚Äôt hurry. Don‚Äôt fight the silence inside.
        Breathe deep. Feel your heart steady like the earth beneath your feet.

        You are more than this test.
        You are the stories you‚Äôve lived, the dreams you carry, the courage that never left.

        Remember,like bamboo, you bend but do not break.
        This exam is just a stone in your river;
        You are the flowing, unstoppable current.

        When doubt tries to hold you back,
        Think of the leader who said:
        ‚ÄòTo stand when it‚Äôs hard,that is victory.‚Äô
        Hold that courage tight.

        Have unwavering confidence.
        Know this,every answer you write, every effort you make, belongs in the battle plan.
        You don‚Äôt need to guess the marking scheme. Your preparation, your knowledge that is your strategy.
        Stand firm. Trust in yourself and the work you‚Äôve done. Victory follows those who believe in their cause.

        Now go not with fear, but with the quiet power of someone who knows:
        They are ready. They are enough.
        Your light will not be dimmed.      

        Do your best.
        And maybe,just maybe,your best will be all that is needed

    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you vs. you.
    Don‚Äôt compete with others. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to them.
    If you truly want to grow, compete only with the person you were yesterday,true 
    Growth comes when you stop comparing and start evolving
